# Yet another chip 8 emulator
### This is my take on chip 8 interpreter 

It mostly works. Input is a little bit buggy but works.  
Right now I'm mainly focusing on porting it to GD32 based microcontroller so fixing input on PC isn't my top priority.

## Implementation status

|                 | Status      |
|-----------------|-------------|
| Chip-8 instructions | Fully supported |
| Timers | TODO |
| Super Chip-48 instructions | TODO |
| Display | Working (ncurses) |
| Keyboard | Partial support, needs improvement |
